    directory correctly.

Changes since 3.0
-------------------
  . Changed default to not export device subtypes for CDrom/floppy/parallel/serial
    ports. This improves portability between Workstation and ESX. This can be
    controlled with the -exportDeviceSubtypes option.
  . Fixed bug in handling of message bundles
  . Fixed bug in handling of misaligned memory sizes

Changes since 2.1.0
-------------------
  . Supported values for diskMode and ipAllocationPolicy have changed. See --help for more info.
  . Support for vSphere 5.1.
  . Lossless support when exporting OVFs/VMXs.
  . Support for reading/writing sha256 manifests. See --help for more info.
  . Improved security by verifying SSL thumbprints. This is controlled by the options
    --sourceSSLThumbprint, --targetSSLThumbprint, and --noSSLVerify. The default
    is to verify and prompt for acceptance.

    (see http://labs.vmware.com/flings/vapprun).
  . Support for OVF Tool on the Mac OS X operating system (Intel-only).
  . A lax mode (--lax) that enables a best-effort conversion of OVF
    packages which do not fully conform to the OVF standard or include
    virtual hardware that is not supported by the destination. For example,
    VirtualBox (version 3.0 and 3.1) produced OVF packages can be converted in lax mode.
  . Bug fix for handling vmxnet3 targets.

FAQ
------------------
Q: How do I use OVF Tool with VMware Server 2.0.x?
A: VMware Server 2.0.x default port is 8333. To connect to a VMware Server 2.0
   host use vi://username:password@hostname:8333/ as target/source.

Q: What type of X.509 certificates does OVF Tool use?
A: X509 certicates used for OVF Tool must be properly formatted so that each
   line in the base64 encoding is 64 characters long except the last line which
   may be shorter. This conforms to RFC 1421(cf. page 12,
   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1421.txt).

Q: Can I use the OVF Tool on the ESX Service Console?
A: Yes. However, you must use a VI locator as a target (use localhost as the
   host), and specify the username/password for the host. Using a file
   target (i.e., a file path directly to a VMFS volume) will generate
   files that are incompatible with ESX.

Q: Can I use OVF tool on an ESX host to backup a VMX file?
A: Yes, but you have to use a VI source locator to export the virtual machine
   to an OVF package. Do not use OVF Tool directly on the VMX files on a VMFS
   filesystem.

Q: How do I encode special characters in locators?
A: The locators are URLs, so special characters must be escaped using % followed
   by their ASCII hex value. For instance, if you use a "@" in your password, it 
   must be escaped with %40 as in vi://foo:b%40r@hostname, and a slash in
   a Windows domain name (\) can be specified as %5c.

Q: Which versions of vSphere support OVF packages with ISO/floppy images?
A: vSphere 4.1 and later. You can use the flag --noImageFiles to ignore upload
   of ISO and floppy image files for older versions of vSphere.

Q: When using a windows network share as target filesystem it fails with "Failed to create disk:
   \\some_server\Public\test-disk1.vmdk. Reason: The destination file system does
   not support large files."
A: A workaround for this is to assign a drive letter for the network share or
   add support for "compression", "unicode on disk" and "persistent ACLs" as filesystem
   attributes on the shared filesystem.
